# C++ Neural Network and Adam Method

This project contains a basic implementation in C++ for a neural network and the Adam optimization algorithm.

## Introduction

This repository provides:
- Structures to build a basic neural network with dense and activation layers.
- An implementation of the Adam method, which is an optimization algorithm for training neural networks that combines the stochastic gradient descent and momentum.

## Features

- **Neural Network Components**: Includes dense layers and various activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
- **Adam Optimization**: Implements the Adam optimization algorithm for efficient training of neural networks.

## Installation

To build the project, you will need CMake and a C++ compiler. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Palpal16/CppNeuralNetwork.git
    cd CppNeuralNetwork
    ```

2. Create a build directory:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```

4. Build the project:
    ```sh
    make
    ```
